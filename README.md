# The Composite Pattern (A structural design pattern)

The Composite Design Pattern provides a unified interface to access individual instances and compositions of objects, which is especially valuable when dealing with part-whole heirarchies.
* Manages tree structures of related objects
* Allows working with individual instances and compositions of objects uniformly
* Simplifies code on the client side 

## How it works
* Both leaf and composite types must adopt a common interface
* Composite types delegates to sub-elements
* Simple types execute the request themselves

## Polymorphism
* Isolates concrete types and traversal logic from clients

## Benefits
* Reduces code complexity
* Adding new types or changing existing ones does not affect client code

## Pitfall
* Overgeneralization
* Incorrect common interface

## Conclusion
The Composite simplifies the management of object collections with hierarchical relationship
